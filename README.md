# Kathematics
Formally known as Chem-Ram-Alpha
This is an android application that is aimed towards Chemistry students to help them balance chemical reactions.

# Introduction:
The application uses the concepts of matrices, HashMaps, and other datastructures when trying to balence chemical reactions. After searching the web for possible solutions for APIs regarding this application.

# Process:
Our chemical balancer currently balences only basic reactions where we know the reactants and the products.
 
# Example:
 H2O + CO2 --> H2CO3

 The solution to this question would be:
 -->: 2H2O + CO2 ---> H2CO3

# Conclusion
To sum up the average rate of success for this style of balancing goes up to 80%. We are continously coming up with new ways and finding newer APIs to utlize in our efforts to balence chemical reactions. For more information regarding this application, refer to the PDF document included in this repository.

# Current Limitations and Issues
- Balancing Redox reactions returning incorrect answers
- Combustion reactions not working out.
- Android version does not have database for element reference
- Flipping phone into landscape mode causes app to crash

# Future plans
In the future, we hope to be able to incorporate not only chemical reaction balancers, but also other aspects of chemistry to both supplement and inspire the next generation of chemistry enthusiasts.

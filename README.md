This is an android application that is aimed towards Chemistry students to help them balance chemical reactions.

Introduction:
The application uses the concepts of matrices, HashMaps, and other datastructures when trying to balence chemical reactions. After searching the web for possible solutions for APIs regarding this application.

Process:
Our chemical balencer currently balences only basic reactions where we know the reactants and the products.
 
 Example:
 H2O + CO2 --> H2CO3
 The solution to this question would be:
 -->: 2H2O + CO2 ---> H2CO3
This is the concept that we are trying to implement using our version of a chemical reaction balancer.

We try to balence other types of reaction in a similar light. To sum up the average rate of success for this style of balancing goes up to 80%. We are continously coming up with new ways and finding newer APIs to utlize in our efforts to balence chemical reactions.
